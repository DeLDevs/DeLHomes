# DeLHomes

This plugin adds a homes system with exactly as many features as you want.

## Commands
- `/home`
- `/homes`
- `/sethome`
- `/delhome`
- `/back`
They all do exactly what you'd expect.

## Config
As of right now, all you can change is the maximum number of homes.

All player data is stored in JSON (you're welcome)

## Installation
It's a plugin. Just install it the way you install a plugin.
